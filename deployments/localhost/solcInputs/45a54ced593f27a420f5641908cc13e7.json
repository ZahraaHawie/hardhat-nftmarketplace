Send the NFT to the contract. Transfer -> Contract \"Hold\" the NFT.\n    2. (Gas Expensive) Marketplace will own NFT. Owner can still hold their NFT, \n       and give the marketplace approval to sell the NFT form them. \n       The owners of the entity could withdraw approval at any time \n       and the marketplace wouldn't be able to sell it anymore.\n\n        We will use the second one. People still will have ownership of their NFTs, \n        and the marketplace will just have approval to actually swap and \n        sell their NFT once the prices are met.\n\n(A): We have to call getApproved(_tokenId) fct from ERC721 to make sure that the marketplace\nis approved to work with the NFT. So we need to import ERC721 Interface.\n\n(B): we're probably going to want to have some type of data structure \nto list all these NFTs: Array or mapping or ??  \nMapping is better than array since when someone wants to buy an item, we are gonna have\nto traverse through the array.. We have to put mapping as state variable above. \n\n(C): We want to make sure we only list NFTs that haven't already been listed.\nAdd modifier : Not listed\nAdd other modifier : owner of the nft \n\n(D): \"external\" because only people outside of this contract are going to call buyItem.\n\"Payable\": people can spend ETH or any other currency.\nTo actually buy these prices we want \"ChainlinkPriceFeeds\" for listing. \nUse chainlink pricefeeds to convert the priceof these tokens into \nhow much they actually cost. \n\nIn ListItem function:\nChallenge: Have this contract accept payment in a subset of tokens\nHint: Use price feeds to convert the price of the tokens \nbetween each other. \n\nNow, inisde BuyItem function: we have to make sure that item is listed before buying. \nAdd modifier called: isListed\n\n(E): \nWe want to create another data structure called proceeds \nwhere we keep track of how much money people have earned selling their NFTs.\n(mapping)\nSo when somebody buys an item, is will update their proceeds.\n\n(F): Notice something here, we don't just send the seller the money. \nNow why is that? Well, solidity has this concept called pull over push. \nAnd it's considered a best practice when working with solidity, \nyou want to shift the risk associated with transferring ether to the user. \n\nSo instead of sending the money to the user, this is what we don't want to do\n-We want to have them withdraw the money.\n\nWe don't want to send the money directly.. \nWe want to create his proceeds data structure \n& we can have them withdraw from it later.\n\nWe use \"SafeTransformFrom\" \nCheck to make sure the NFT was transferred.. \n\n(G):\n\nReentrancy Attacks: \nIn this BuyItem function we have set this up in a way that is safe from something \ncalled \"Reentrancy Attack\". Check Reentrant Vulnerable contract. \n\nimport from openzeppelin.. ReentrancyGuard and then add the modifier in\nany function we are nervous about it.\n\n\nCheck out https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/Artion-Contracts/blob/5c90d2bc0401af6fb5abf35b860b762b31dfee02/contracts/FantomMarketplace.sol\nFor a full decentralized nft marketplace\n\n*/\n"
